# Pfy

A tool to help developers and teams to create and share very useful prompts.

The project is in the early stages of development, so it is not stable yet.

The goal is to create a tool that can be used to create and share prompts that can be used in the terminal. 

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main parts:

- core - The core of the project, where the main logic is implemented.
- cli - The command line interface of the project.
- web - The web interface of the project. Here the user can create and share prompts.

## Kind of Prompts

1. Simple shell commands
2. Multiple choice questions (with shell commands)
3. Text input
4. File generation
5. Wrapper for other prompts
6. Custom prompts
7. Custom prompts with user friendly interface (text input, multiple choice, etc.)
